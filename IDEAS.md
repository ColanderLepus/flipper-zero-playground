# Project Ideas

This file contains a list of ideas for future applications and guides to add to this project.

## Applications

*   **Multi-View Application:**
    *   **Goal:** Create an application that uses multiple views (screens) and allows the user to navigate between them. This will be a step up from the single-screen `hello_flipper_ui` example.
    *   **Key Concepts:** This will involve using the `ViewDispatcher` to manage different `View` objects.
    *   **Research:** The "User Interface" guide listed in our [Primary Resources](guide/resources.md) should contain the necessary documentation on `ViewDispatcher` and `View`.

*   **Blinking LED Application:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a simple application that makes the Flipper Zero's LED blink. This is a fundamental hardware interaction example.
    *   **Key Concepts:** This will involve using Flipper Zero's GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) functions to control the LED.
    *   **Research:** Look into `furi_hal_gpio` functions and examples for LED control.
