# 🐬 Flipper Zero Beginner's Guide

A collection of step-by-step guides for getting started with Flipper Zero app development. This project covers environment setup, a "Hello World" example, a basic UI tutorial, and deployment.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository contains both Flipper Zero applications and guides that show how they were made. The `guides` directory serves as the knowledge base, providing a clear and straightforward path for beginners to get their first applications up and running using `uFBT` (the micro Flipper Build Tool).

## 📖 The Guides

The guides are designed to be read in order:

1.  **[Setup and Create Guide](guides/setup_and_create_guide.md)** 💻  
Walks you through installing VS Code, Python, and `uFBT` on a Windows machine, and creating a new application.

2.  **[Hello World Guide](guides/flipper_hello_world_guide.md)** 👋  
Shows you how to generate and build the default "Hello World" application provided by `uFBT`, which prints log messages.

3.  **[Hello Flipper UI Tutorial](guides/hello_flipper_ui_tutorial.md)** 🎨  
Explains how to create an application that draws text directly on the Flipper's screen.

4.  **[Deployment Guide](guides/deployment_guide.md)** 🚀  
Covers the different ways to get your application onto your Flipper Zero.

## 💻 The Code

These are the Flipper Zero applications that the guides teach you how to build:

*   **[`hello-flipper`](src/hello-flipper/)**  
A minimal application that prints "Hello world" to the Flipper Zero's log.

*   **[`hello-flipper-ui`](src/hello-flipper-ui/)**  
A simple UI application that displays "Hello, Flipper!" on the device screen using a `ViewPort`.
